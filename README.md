# Real-vs.Synthetic-Machine-learning-approaches-for-image-classification

The use of advanced artificial intelligence is leading to the generation of highly realistic synthetic images. It
raises the issue: how does one differentiate an authentic visual
from its fake? In this research, the question is addressed by
comprehending the conceptual machine learning models meant
to classify either images as real or synthetic. Advances in
feature extraction, such as Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT),
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and Wavelet Transforms, are
to be used in identifying distinguishing features. A diverse
dataset is used to build models capable of retaining robustness
and generalization in classifying different image types and
complexities. Incorporating Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explanations (LIME) increases the interpretability and transparency of the classification process. LIME provides a visible
insight for the model predictions emphasizing on various localized
characterization features and image areas most contributing to
the classification process. It gives an extra insight into why and
how a decision came about and how it can be revamped for even
better. This integrated approach aims to build an accurate and
interpretable methodology to manage the increasing challenge of
image authenticity classification
